In the same hunt, if the host player is inside the investigation area and is neither the primary nor the secondary target, the Banshee will also be attracted to the host player through voice or electronics, but will not be able to achieve line-of-sight with or kill them.

Though the ghost always knows where the player is, its slow speed near a player opens up more opportunities to escape even in places where one would normally die, such as the Edgefield Street House kitchen or garage.

Make sure that everyone\'s electronics are turned off as well to prevent the ghost from being naturally led to the room. If the ghost sounds very fast as it rushes directly to where players are located before slowing down as it gets close, then it is a Deogen. A more advanced version of this strategy, applicable to larger maps, is to have players hiding across several different locations, each with varying distances to the ghost room.

Video cameras and cameras that are thrown also do not cause the Raiju to speed up.'], "strats": ["In order to mitigate the risk of an early hunt, it is best to turn off and/or remove any unneeded electronic equipment from the ghost room; this also prevents the Raiju from harnessing this equipment to empower itself while hunting. Lazily discarding such equipment is a reliable way to make a Raiju extremely dangerous. Additionally, players often have the reflex of discarding electronic items behind them when a hunt starts to not attract the ghost's attention to them; this should be avoided with Raijus to not leave a trail of electronic equipment to power his speed ability. Instead, players should either switch to a non-electronic item or an electronic item that can be turned off.", 'The Raiju may be readily-identified by being mindful of its speed during a hunt, particularly on small maps, so long as there are active electronic items nearby.

Turning off the lights in the ghost's room may also help.", "Given the Shade's inability to hunt in a room with players, one can be tested for in Nightmare difficulty simply by lowering the average sanity close to zero, and having players standing in the ghost's current room and rooms directly adjacent.

If it hunts only after three minutes, it is very likely (though not conclusively) a Spirit. Note that if it hunts within the first minute of the smudge stick being used, then the smudge stick did not work, and the player should attempt to smudge it again.

Likewise, if the ghost hunts early and has high levels of activity, but becomes less willing to hunt, interact, or perform ghost events over time, this could also point to a Thaye.', 'Because ghost events and interactions are more common early on, one should use this opportunity to complete any objectives or fill the journal with photos. Taking the hunt sanity threshold into consideration, if one is careful with how they interact with the ghost, a (near-)perfect contract can be achieved easily, but if players spend excessive time in the ghost room and are not careful with their cursed possession, completing objectives and obtaining photo evidence could become an annoying (or boring) task.']},

For example, identifying Fingerprints, Ghost Orbs, and Freezing Temperatures usually indicates a Hantu, but as The Mimic creates orbs, Spirit Box evidence has to be definitively ruled out before a Hantu can be confirmed. Players should be conscientious searching for evidence if such a situation arises. Greater attention will have to be paid to this point in Nightmare difficulty, as players will normally be given only two evidences, though conclusively identifying three pieces of evidence in Nightmare will also confirm the ghost as The Mimic.', 'Concerning evidence, noting the behavior of specific ghost types, but getting evidence that they do not have, can bring The Mimic into suspicion, allowing for more focused evidence-gathering.

This can be be especially troublesome on bigger maps like Asylum when trying to locate the ghost room. However, the wandering Twin's inability to give evidence past EMF Level 5 can also be used against it: using a thermometer and noting a lack of Freezing Temperatures (or, at the very least, notable temperature drops) where ghost activity is noted, or failing to receive Spirit Box responses in rooms near where interactions occurred, are strong signs of the antics of a wandering Twin causing trouble.", 'Due to The Twins having two choices in regards to angles of attack for any given hunt, it is recommended to plan for the event that one of the Twins "blocks" a planned escape route.']},

If no footprints are visible, even under UV light, the ghost is most likely a Wraith; at the same time, visible footprints definitely rule out a Wraith.
